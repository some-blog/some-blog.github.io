# Forward 
I'm too lazy to make 1 page for every day - I also think that would be messy and difficult to manage. Instead, I'm going to make 1 post and slowly update data to it. 

Eventually I may break this up to different pages and layer on different organizational schemes... That's if I need it, who knows. This blog thing is new so I'm trying not to think about it too hard and get lost in the details.

            <li> Thin sliced onions sauteed in olive oil and garlic (added some red pepper flakes but I don't think that did anything) </li>
            <li> Shreaded Pepper Jack Cheese (1 serving) </li>
            <li> 1 Tbsp of Siracha and Bbq sauce</li>

      <td> I toasted the bread in the panini maker and discovered that it's still too crunchy to eat. I'm not sure I fully understand the toast to crunch ratio or if it's the wrong type of bread I'm using. Also, a note on bread: this one was bought from the store, but I'm researching different breads to start making my own that works good in panini's.</td>
