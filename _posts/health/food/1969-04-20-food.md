# Forward 
I'm too lazy to make 1 page for every day - I also think that would be messy and difficult to manage. Instead, I'm going to make 1 post and slowly update data to it. 

Eventually I may break this up to different pages and layer on different organizational schemes... That's if I need it, who knows. This blog thing is new so I'm trying not to think about it too hard and get lost in the details.

# 2023-06-06 -> ? 
Trying to get back on the horse after the weekend of funzies. 

# 2023-06-02 -> 06-04
Was surprised by my partner for a trip to the middle of nowhere to go hiking. Was neat but ate whaver we could find so while it was definitely trackable I didn't track because... Well life is too short so sometimes just live and let live or whatever.

This meal set was used for a handful of days while we ate the same dinner and I experimented with the lunch panini. Thoughts below.

            Burger Patty (Any meat works, but I forgot to go <br/>
            shopping and this was a lucky frozen find. Lucky <br/>
            being a soft term given the health facts of the <br/>
            burger weren't great). </li>

                    Used grilled Chicken brests with this as well. Was much <br/>
                    easier to eat when using the chicken breasts. The burger <br/>
                    patty was bigger than the sandwich which caused some <br/>
                    logstical issues.

            Thin sliced onions sauteed in olive oil and garlic <br/>
            (added some red pepper flakes but I don't think that <br/> 
            did anything) </li>
            <li> Shreaded Pepper Jack Cheese (1 serving) </li>

                Zuccini (more than you think, each person eating <br/>
                could probably consume 1/serving) quartered into 1/4 <br/>
                inch pieces and air fried with a pinch of salt, <br/>

                Mix with 1 portion of cooked rice at the end

                (Optional) Add in a touch of soy sauce or siracha <br/>
                at the end to try and tie the flavors together. The <br/>
                soy sauce (or amino acids for a low sodium option) <br/>
                help counteract any blandness that comes from this <br/>
                being mostly just vegetables and low to no seasonings.

## After Thoughts: 
* Bread Attempt 1: I toasted the bread in the panini maker and discovered that it's still too crunchy to eat. I'm not sure I fully understand the toast to crunch ratio or if it's the wrong type of bread I'm using. Also, a note on bread: this one was bought from the store, but I'm researching different breads to start making my own that works good in panini's.
* Bread Attempt 2: I toasted the bread inverted to how I did it before (soft side being what got toasted) and it kept the crunch and avoided much of the fragility of the external loaf. This seems to be a good alternative for this methodology but still begs the question what is the "best" way to do this.
