# Ausable Chasm, NY

## Summary  
Out in the middle of nowhere New York, near the Canadian border and possibly nothing else, sits a crack in the Earth named Ausable Chasm. There are many trails to take through and around the chasm that allow you to get an up close and personal view of the water in the chasm, or to feel the height and magnitude of the crevice atop 100 foot cliffs over the rapids. 

If you’re looking for a summer excursion with your family/kids (10-18 for best results) then this trip could be excellent - especially when tubing is open in July. If your hiking experiences do not include rapids, chasms, or waterfalls this could be excellent opportunity to add them. If you’re a moderately well hiked individual then this hike may leave you disgusted by a capitalist system employing tall fences and forced tours just to profit of people experiencing the planet. 

## Our Experience 
From the photos/videos we saw online we had much higher expectations than what we experienced when we got there - so keep that in mind for the duration of my explanation. 

It starts with us realizing that there's nowhere we can go to escape the glutton of capitalism. It cost us almost $100 to walk through the chasm which I find ridiculous; some town decided to stick a fence up around a natural formation and hide it from the public unless they can pay to play - disgusting. Note that we did NOT pay to do the high ropes course or anything special. We just wanted to walk down the trail and get close to the water and to do so had to pay. 

Once we get down to the water we're told we have to wear a helmet, why they couldn't explain. Having, at this point, not signed any releases/wavers/anything, our intended hike through the chasm has become a scene out of "Bubble Boy." We were also forced to pace ourselves along with a tour guide we were not expecting to have - which was a frustrating experience given we were hoping to try and take some fun photos which could no longer occur. They also had strict rules on where we could be, we wanted to get closer to the falls but were unable to as the Tour guide got frustrated with our interests in exploration.

Walking around under the watchful eyes of Big Brother was frustrating and definitely influenced our opinion of the views. We definitely found them to be pretty though would hold off on any golden reviews given the related experience.

When you finish the guided tour, the guide tells you to go one direction if you're doing rafting and the opposite direction if you're not rafting. Given we were annoyed with the governance of the hike, we decided to ignore the rules and go in the direction of rafting. This lead us about a half of the mile deeper into the Chasm and had some exciting views we were happy not to miss. 

After this, we circled back to the visiters center and got a ticket to go rafting. Originally, we believed that rafting would be the same path we were hiking so the consideration was "why do the same trail twice where one time is in the water?" That was very wrong and when we realized it we decided to extend the day with rafting. Luckily, our benevolent corporate overlords were nice enough to avoid charging us for a whole new ticket set. Instead, they refunded our original tickets and purchased a ticket set with the addons, so all we had to do was pay the difference. From there it was a quick back and load up on the rafts.

As we got on the raft, we noticed a strange couple who seemed to be pretty in love and having a great time. We didn't think much of it until we were crammed on a raft and could do nothing but smell the liquor oozing off them. As we float down the river and ride the rapids, we learned about the many floods that have destroyed the valley and how their construction techniques in the area have changed because of it. Most notably, was the interesting factoid that some trees near the side of the chasm walls grow down towards the water because the sunlights reflection is their primary source of light - it was a bummer that it was too overcast to really see/experience that. 

By the end of the rapids, we decided it was time to call it a day and go back to our campsite and roast some marshmallows. A day not spent optimally hiking/exploring, but definitely a day spent well together.

## So it's not worth it? 
I did not say that. Our experience was frustrating as our expectations/excitement was much higher than where we felt things landed. That said, as mentioned in the summary, there are situations under which going could be a lot of fun. If you think you're one of those reasons, I highly recommend to go and learn from our mistakes. 

# When to go 
When you go depends on what you want to do. If you're interested in rafting your experience will depending on when in the year you go will determine the rapid pacing/intensity. Spring is faster with it slowing all year until fall. Tubing starts in July so you can't go before that and If you're just going to hike then go before tubing opens up to limit who's around. 

# What to do
* Find a place to stay and show up the night before.
* Get up early and aim to be at the chasm opening before 9 when the visitors center opens. 
* It doesn't matter where you park, if you show up early the parking should be available and all over. 
Ticket Purchasing Considerations 
* Buy tickets for the adventure trail. It’s listed as the most difficult but it gets you up suspended over the chasm on a ropes course and you’re able to see angles nobody else can. 
  * River walk trail is a tame alternative to the adventure trail. You still cross the river though without the ropes corse it’s via suspension bridges. 
* If you get tubing you should consider paying for “unlimited trips,” though scope out the return walk so you know how difficult that is before you do.
* Rafting is a relaxing experience that is worthwhile regardless of when you go. It exposes you to parts of the chasm that you can't see from just walking the different trails.
